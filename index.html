            Apple Vision Pro is Apple’s first 3D camera. You can capture magical
            spatial photos and spatial videos in 3D, then relive those cherished
            moments like never before with immersive Spatial Audio. Your
            existing library of photos and videos looks incredible at remarkable
            scale — and coming this fall, you’ll be able to transform your 2D
            photos into spatial photos with just a tap. Even panoramas wrap
            around you — making you feel like you’re standing right where you
            took them. You can also take spatial videos with iPhone 15 Pro, then
            view them on Apple Vision Pro.
